If combined with Grass Pledge, the ally uses Fire Pledge with 150 power and a sea of fire appears on the target's side for 4 turns, which causes damage to non-Fire types equal to 1\/8 of their maximum HP, rounded down, at the end of each turn during effect, including the last turn. If combined with Water Pledge, the ally uses Water Pledge with 150 power and a rainbow appears on the user's side for 4 turns, which doubles secondary effect chances but does not stack with the Serene Grace Ability.
